# Problem Set #1: Concurrent Programming w/o Dependencies

## Overview

Multithreading is a feature in a CPU that allows subdividing specific operations within a single application into individual threads that can run in parallel. In this Java-based simulator, we capitalize on multithreading to  optimize the simultaneous execution of particle processing tasks, maintain a consistent frame rate, and minimize lag. Leveraging Java's multithreading libraries and capabilities, we distribute computational workloads across multiple threads to maximize CPU utilization. In the following sections of this paper, we go into detail about our approach, emphasizing the critical role of multithreading in enabling an efficient and responsive simulation.
